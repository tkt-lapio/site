One must pass the exam in order to receive a grade from the course. The exam is taken in Moodle, where you log in using your University account.

<h3>Rules in the exam:</h3>

{%- assign data = site.data.data -%}
- Exam opens in Moodle {{data.exam.startdate}} at {{data.exam.endtime}}.
- Students can start the exam anywhere and anytime they wish, as long as it's done before {{data.exam.enddate}} at {{data.exam.endtime}}.
- You have three (3) hours to pass the exam.
- Students are allowed to use the internet during the exam.
- Students are allowed to search for information on the internet and visit for example forums or other similar resources during the exam.
- Students can also test out any commands they wish: actually this is highly recommended and sometimes even necessary. Make sure you pass the exam in a Unix-like environment or Windows' bash shell.
- The exam must be taken alone. Students are not allowed to work together during the exam. Asking for help from a course assistant or any other person directly or indirectly is strictly forbidden. Students also must not use others' answers as their own. All such acts are perceived as cheating and will have consequences.
- The computer you pass the exam on has to have Git installed.
- If you have access to the CS department's computers, we recommend passing the exam on one of them.
- Each question and answer option is written in Finnish and in English. Please let us know immediately if this is not the case.
- The exam consists of mostly multiple choice questions, and "short answers", where the answer is for example a command name. In some questions the user is required to for example download a file and run commands on the command line.

<h3>Grading:</h3>
- The grading scale is the following:
  - Failed
  - 3
  - 5
- The exam counts for 18 points.
- 9 points are required to pass the course and 17 points are required for the grade 5.
- If you don't pass the exam, you can retake it for an unlimited amount of times, until {{data.exam.enddate}}. There must be a week between each retake.
- The exam contains exercises of one and two points.
- Moodle gives you an unofficial grade which you can see in your gradebook. This unofficial grade might be incorrect if you score under 9 points in exam.
